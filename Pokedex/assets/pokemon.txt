Bulbasaur is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokemon.
It evolves into Ivysaur, which evolves into Venusaur.
Bulbasaur is a small, quadruped Pokemon with green or bluish green skin and dark patches. Its thick legs each end with three sharp claws. Its eyes have red irises, while the sclera and pupils are white. Bulbasaur has a pair of small, pointed teeth visible when its mouth is open. It has a bulb on its back, grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.
Having been domesticated from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokemon. 
It is known to be extremely loyal even after long-term abandonment. 
Bulbasaur has also shown itself to be an excellent caretaker, even having a special technique called the "Bulba-by." To perform this technique, Bulbasaur uses its vines to pick up a young Pokemon and soothingly rocks the young one in the air.
It is found in grasslands and forests. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as starter Pokemon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer.

Ivysaur is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokemon.

Ivysaur is a dinosaur-like, quadruped Pokemon. It has blue-green skin with darker patches. Two pointed teeth protrude from its upper jaw, and it has narrow red to purple eyes. Each of its feet have three claws on them. 
The bulb on its back has bloomed into a large pink bud supported by a short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds. The weight of this bud prevents Ivysaur from standing on its hind legs and forces its legs to grow sturdy. When its plant is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, strong sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming evolution. 
Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. 
Ivysaur's natural habitat is plains. However, it is rare, as many are in captivity.

Venusaur is a squat, quadruped Pokemon with bumpy, bluish green skin. It has small, circular red eyes, two pointed teeth on its upper jaw, and four pointed teeth on its lower jaw. It has three clawed toes on each foot. 
The bud on its back has bloomed in a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur will have a seed in the center of its flower.
As Mega Venusaur, the flower on its back grows larger and two new, pink flowers bloom, one on its forehead and one on its rear. Additional leaves with woody stems are grown around the flower that are supported by vines that grow from the base of the flower. Mega Venusaur also develops darker patches of color on its forehead below the new bloom. Its legs and frame also become more sturdy to support the weight of the flower.
Venusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to take on colors that are more vibrant. The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pokemon. This scent becomes stronger after a rainy day.
This Pokemon is rarely found in the wild, but has been known to inhabit grasslands.

Ekans is a Poison-type Pokemon.
It evolves into Arbok.
Ekans is a purple, serpentine Pokemon. Its eyes, underbelly, stripe, and rattle are yellow. Ekans has three pairs of black lines encircling its body, as well as another line that connects each slitted eye and curves toward its nose. Its large mouth has a round, pink tongue and no visible teeth.
Ekans moves stealthily through grass and preys on Eggs from Pidgey and Spearow nests, but can strike other prey from behind. It grows longer with age and wraps itself around tree branches at night to rest. If not in a tree, it will coil itself up—a position in which it can defend itself from all directions. Its jaw can detach to swallow large prey, but such a meal can make Ekans too heavy to move. A newborn Ekans's bite is painful, but not venomous. It flicks its tongue out to detect danger and the scent of prey. Ekans lives in grassy savannas and plains.

Arbok is a Poison-type Pokemon. 
It evolves from Ekans.
Arbok is a serpentine Pokemon with purple scales over most of its body. It has a large hood just below its head.

The pattern typically has red and yellow eyespot outlined it black, a wide black streak resembling a mouth, and a V-shaped stripe about the face pattern.
Arbok is capable of crushing opponents by coiling its body around them and constricting them. It can even flatten steel oil drums. If it encounters an enemy, it raises its head, intimidating the opponent with the frightening pattern on its body and making eerie sounds by expelling air from its mouth. It has been stated that if any part of Arbok's body except for the head is cut off, it can regrow the rest of its body again in a matter of a few weeks. Arbok has been known to be capable of spending long periods underwater and surviving in aquatic environments.

With a vengeful nature, it will not give up a chase once it targets its prey or an opponent, no matter how far. It makes its home in grassy savannas and plains. In the wild, it hunts smaller Pokemon, using the pattern on its hood to immobilize prey and using its toxic bite to finish them off.
